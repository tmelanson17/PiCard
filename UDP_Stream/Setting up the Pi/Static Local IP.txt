First we have to get the Local IP of the Pi, Mask, and Gateway..

NOTE: IF YOU ARE USING ETHERNET INSTEAD OF A WIFI ADAPTER, CHANGE SWITCH 'wlan0' WITH 'eth0'
THROUGHOUT THE GUIDE


	# Retrieve the local IP and Mask using ifconfig in the wlan0 section
	$ ifconfig
		inet addr – 130.108.202.2 (Pi's Current IP Address)
		Mask:255.255.252.0
	
	# Get the Gateway with netstat
	$ netstat -nr
		Gateway 130.108.200.1 
		
	# Change the 'iface wlan0 inet dhcp' section to the example below.
	# Note the change of 'dhcp' to 'static'
	$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
		iface wlan0 inet static
		address XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX # Static IP you want 
		netmask XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
		gateway XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX   # IP of your router
